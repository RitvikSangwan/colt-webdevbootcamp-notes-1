## HTTP Requests: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- One of the main foundations of communicating on the www.
- the main protocol that allows us to share (request and receive resources!) information and data in the web.

## Web Server: A Computer*that can satify requests on the web

## The Request/Response cycle

1. Our Web browsers send a HTTP request.
2. It finds its way eventually to the appropriate server/s.
3. Servers respond with a Web page.
4. The server responds with instructions with code that my browser can understand.
5. So the job of my browser is essentially to display or to render content for the user, for humans, for human eyes/ears.
